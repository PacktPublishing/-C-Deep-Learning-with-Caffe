# C++ Deep Learning with Caffe [Video]
This is the code repository for [C++ Deep Learning with Caffe [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/c-deep-learning-caffe-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788622684), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
C++ deep larning with Caffe  aims to get C++ programmers started with concepts of Deep learning. You will learn what it means to be Deep in the technical sense of the word. You will see how to install Caffe on a fresh Ubuntu from the scratch, run code, inspect and understand the output, look at many important data structures used. You will see how to go through the process of preparing data, training, deploying, testing, fine-tuning etc. You will get clarity on on some common misconceptions about deep learning and components. There are frequent code references as well as conceptual insights that will help you get started with Deep learning with Caffe and enable you to start experimenting on your own!
